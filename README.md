🧠 Digit Recognizer - AI Web App

This is a machine learning-based web app that predicts handwritten digits (0–9) using a trained CNN model on the MNIST dataset. It was built as my first full AI + Web integration project!

🚀 Features

- Upload an image of a handwritten digit
- Model predicts the digit instantly
- Built using Flask + TensorFlow
- Simple and clean web interface
- Entire project developed and understood step-by-step!

🖥️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Flask**
- **HTML/CSS (Jinja2 templates)**
- *(Optional: JavaScript)*

🧠 Model Info

The model was trained using the **MNIST dataset** with a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
It is saved in the file: `mnist_cnn_model.h5`
